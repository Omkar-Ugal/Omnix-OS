# Omnix Kernel

**Omnix** is a modular, AI-augmented experimental operating system kernel written in **Rust** and **C**, featuring:

- 🚫 **Non-POSIX system call interface** (`om_syscall`) for modern interaction models
- 🧠 **Self-adaptive kernel logic** via telemetry + rule-based or ML decision engines
- 🔌 **Pluggable kernel modules** (including safe, sandboxed modules via WebAssembly)
- 🛠️ **Custom hardware abstraction** via a message-driven HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer++)
- 🔐 Built for **memory safety**, **observability**, and **experimentation**

Omnix is designed to be open-source, community-driven, and unlike any Unix-derived kernel you've seen.
